# The Primal Launcher

The Primal Launcher (TPL) is a launcher for long-abandoned PC videogame FFXIV version 1.23b. I aims to transform the game into a single player experience for those who want to experience this game's story and lore. It is *NOT* compatible with later versions of FFXIV, and never will be.
This project is focused on easy of use, so no databases, web servers, compilation or configurations are required to run TPL. All you need is the game installed in your computer, TPL will take care of everything for you.

TPL was built to be an open source, single executable application with no installation. Just download the binary and run the app.
