# FFXIV1.0 Primal Launcher

Introduction
============
This project aims to transform the long-abandoned FFXIV1.0 in a single player experience for those who want to know this game's rich story and lore. 

Features
========
Unlike the other great efforts to bring this game back to life, PL has no complicated installation and compiling processes. You don't need to install a database and/or a web server. The single executable file creates all the necessary files to run the game.

Some of the main features are:
- 1 Click binaries patching process and binaries backup creation;
- Built-in game update downloader and update using original updater for a complete experience;
- Built-in micro web-server to handle http requests using original login window and mock-up login screen mimicking the original one (cand be edited!);

What has been done so far
=========================

I'm still working on basic functionality. So far it is possible to launch the game, create/delete characters and enter the game, however there is not much to do in-game as I didn't implement anything but the chat message system yet. It is possible to walk around the map though.

TODO
====

The next steps are:
- Zone teleportation (to change maps and walk around :)
- Change weather, music and Dalamud phase
- Proper world creation with NPCs and zone info;
- Create game actors and load objects into the game;
