# FFXIV1.0 Primal Launcher

Introduction
============
This project aims to transform the long-abandoned FFXIV1.0 in a single player experience for those who want to experience this game's rich story and lore. 

Features
========
Unlike the other great efforts to bring this game back to life, PL has no complicated installation and compiling processes. You don't need to install a database and/or a web server. The single executable file creates all the necessary files to run the game.

Some of the main features are:
- 1 Click binaries patching process and binaries backup creation;
- Built-in game update files downloader and updater;
- Built-in micro web-server to handle http requests using original login window and mock-up login screen mimicking the original one (can be edited!);
