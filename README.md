# FFXIV1.0 Primal Launcher

Introduction
============
This project aims to transform the long-abandoned PC videogame FFXIV1.0 in a single player experience for those who want to experience this game's rich story and lore. 

Features
========
Unlike the other great efforts to bring this game back to life, PL has no installation or compiling processes. You don't need to install a database and/or a web server. 
The single executable file has all the necessary data to run the game.

Some of the main features are:
- 1 Click binaries patching process and binaries backup creation;
- Built-in game update files downloader and updater;
- Built-in micro web-server to handle http requests using original login window and mock-up login screen mimicking the original one;
