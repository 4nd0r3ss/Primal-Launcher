# FFXIV1.0 Primal Launcher

Introduction
============
This project aims to transform the long-abandoned FFXIV1.0 in a single player experience for those who want to know this game's rich story and lore. 

Features
========
Unlike the other great efforts to bring this game back to life, PL has no complicated installation and compiling processes. You don't need to install a database and/or a web server. The single executable file creates all the necessary files to run the game.

Some of the main features are:
- 1 Click binaries patching process and binaries backup creation;
- Built-in game update downloader and update using original updater for a complete experience;
- Built-in micro web-server to handle http requests using original login window and mock-up login screen mimicking the original one (cand be edited!);

What works so far
=================
- Game update files download;
- Game update to v1.23b and binaries patch;
- Dummy login page
- Character creation & delete
- Game start (no intro cutscene or battle for now)
- Some in-game custom commands
- Mounting
- Static objects load
